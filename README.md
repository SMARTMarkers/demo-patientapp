Patient App Demonstration
=====================

Transcript
---------

In this session, I will not only demonstrate the app, but also show how to build a Patient facing app for Patient Generated Health data  in __less than 10mins__ using SMART Markers

We want to build an app for Patients where they are be able to receive and respond to requests from their practitioners by generating and submitting results, right from  their device all in the FHIR Format. 

Lets start with an empty app with only boilerplate code with two Views.

## Step1: Import SMART Markers framework into the  project directory and as a module in project filesâ€“ usually a simple one liner.

-----------------------------------

## Step2: Configure FHIR endpoints and Initialize

Next, we configure and intialize a FHIR client. The endpoints used here are to access the  SMART Sandbox FHIR server  hosted by our team. But Developers can replace them with anyother compliant FHIR server.


```swift

lazy var fhir: FHIRManager! = {

	// Obtained form SMART Sandbox: https://launch.smarthealthit.org
	let fhir_endpoint = "launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/sim/eyJrIjoiMSIsImIiOiJiODVkN2UwMC0zNjkwLTRlMmEtODdhMC1mM2QyZGZjOTA4YjMifQ/fhir"

	let settings = [
		"client_name"   : "appDemo",
		"client_id"     : "appDemo-id",
		"redirect"      : "smartmarkers-home://smartcallback",
		"scope"         : "openid profile user/*.* launch"
	]

	let client = Client(baseURL: URL(string: fhir_endpoint)!, settings: settings)

	return FHIRManager(main: client, promis: nil)
}()

func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {

	if fhir.main.awaitingAuthCallback {
		return fhir.main.didRedirect(to: url)
	}
	
	if url.scheme == "smpro" {
		fhir.callbackManager?.handleRedirect(url: url)
	}
	
	return false
}
```
-----------------------------------

## Step 3: SMART Authorization sequence


With that in place, we can now add some code that initiates user authentication,  which, after successful completion,  resolves the most appropriate username from the FHIR resource.  In this case, its the Patient resource

This method, is also part of the SMART lib that is used within the framework

```swift
manager.authorize { [weak self] (success, userName, error) in
	if success {
		if let patientName = userName {
			self?.title = patientName
		}
	}
	else {
		if let error = error {
			self?.showMsg(msg: "Authorization Failed.\n\(error.asOAuth2Error.localizedDescription)")
		}
	}
}
```

-----------------------------------

## Step 4: Get all Requests and Reports for the Patient

Once successfully logged in as a patient, we now want to fetch all the PGHD related `Requests`, the instruments embedded in those requests and any historical `Reports` previously submitted, all appropriately grouped and sorted by thier due dates and completion status.

SMART Markers hides all the quering complexity and exploses APIs todo just that, with only a few lines of code.

```swift
guard let patient = manager.patient else { return }
self.title = "Loading.."

TaskController.Requests(requestType: ServiceRequest.self,
						for: patient,
						server: manager.main.server,
						instrumentResolver: self) { [weak self] (controllers, error) in
	DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Update the UI
		if let controllers = controllers {
			self?.tasks = self?.sort(controllers)
		}
		if nil != error { print(error! as Any) }
		self?.markStandby()
	}
}
```

-----------------------------------

## Step 5: Lets now take a deeper look at one Request and its data in a different View

For this request, I'd like to display its metadata, which means its identifier, request date, and the practitioner  who requested it. 

We also want to list  any previous results that were submited.  

#### 5.1: Metadata in `viewDidLoad()`

```swift
title = "REQ: #" + (task.request?.rq_identifier ?? "-")
graphView.title = task.instrument?.sm_title ?? task.request?.rq_title ?? "-"
graphView.subTitle = (task.request?.rq_categoryCode ?? "CODE: --")
reload()
```
#### 5.2: Populating Previous Reports IN A LIST `cellForRow()`

```swift
let result = reports![indexPath.row]
cell.textLabel?.text = "\(result.rp_date.shortDate): \(result.rp_description ?? "--")"
cell.detailTextLabel?.text = result.rp_observation ?? nil
```

#### 5.3: If I want to further explore the FHIR resource, the framework has built in Viewers that can be readily reused.

```swift
if let viewer = report.rp_viewController {
	self.show(viewer, sender: nil)
}
```


#### Step 7: Add a PGHD session generator

Finally, some code that initiates a data generating session as per the instrument. What I mean by that is, if a Questionnaire was requested, then a survey module is created and presented to the user to record responses which results in a new FHIR  QuestionnaireResponse.

All this, is handled by SMART Markers and its submodules behind the scenes further. This required an enourmous amout of code to precisely parse FHIR elements and create a representative survey session.  

```swift

	var sessionController : SessionController?


	sessionController = SessionController([task],
									  patient: manager.patient!, 
									  server: manager.main.server)

	 
	 sessionController?.prepareController(callback: { (controller, error) in
		 
		 if let controller = controller {
			 controller.view.tintColor = .red
			 self.present(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
		 }
		 
		 else if let error = error {
			 self.showMsg(msg: "Error occurred when creating a session\n\(error.localizedDescription)")
		 }
		 
	 })
	 
	 sessionController?.onConclusion = { [weak self] session in
		 
		 self?.reload()
	 }
```
### With only these few lines, developers completely avoid writing 1000s of lines of code in their apps.

## and.. some error handling.


```swift
extension DetailViewController : SessionControllerDelegate {
    
    
    func sessionEnded(_ session: SessionController, taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, reason: ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason, error: Error?) {
    
        if let error = error {
            print(error as Any)
            print(reason.rawValue)
        }
        reload()
    }
    
    func sessionShouldBegin(_ session: SessionController, taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController, reason: ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason, error: Error?) -> Bool {
        
        return true
    }
}
```

### We are now good to go, lets build and run. While this is an iOS version, we also have a React-Native version for Android and the Web built on similar principles. I'd like to add here that there are many abstraction layers and convinience methods that developers can use as per their need. Not every module is absolutely essential to use. For example, a simple app that is dedicated to only  One instrument, can also be created. Many custom interfaces can be built using SMART Markers.


#### Step 7: Add a submission module

Remember, these results, in the event that the FHIR server is not receive data, as is the case today with EHRs, a different purposeful FHIR server can be created and used in the __Submissions__ module

More information

### A Health app for Patient Generated Health Data

This is a standalone patient facing iOS app built on the [SMART on FHIR][sf] open specification and powered by the [SMART Markers][sm] [framework] to receive and respond to practitioner's _requests_ with PGHD data generated through survey like modules in-app. Built using Swift for iOS.

### PGHD Instruments

The app relies on the SMART Markers framework's supported PGHD instruments to create a data generating user session. Many types of instruments are supported out of the box with more being actively developed. Some examples include: FHIR Questionnaire encoded surveys, [PROMIS][promis] CAT surveys, activity data, sensor based activity tests and more. [Check here][ilist] for a complete list.


Functionality
-------------

1. Users can login to their SMART enabled health system
2. Fetch all practitioner dispatched _requests_ for data
3. Users generate or aggregate health data as per the request and/or the Instrument requested
4. Users submit data to their health systems through the app.


Configuration
------------
0. You will need Xcode version 11.3 and Swift 5.0 and a `FHIR Server` endpoints and optionally their SMART credentials.
1. Clone repository: `$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/smartmarkers/demo-patientapp`
2. Make sure SMARTMarkers and its submodules are downloaded
1. Add SMARTMarkers.xcodeproj, ResearchKit.xcodeproj, SMART.xcodeproj to the application's project workspace
4. Compile ResearchKit and SMARTMarkers.xcodeproj
5. Go to Project Settings -> General Tab and add the three frameworks and HealthKit to the `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`.
6. Build and run the app


You will need a SMART on FHIR endpoint to get started
```swift
extension FHIRManager {

    /**
     SMART Sandbox Credentials take from Config.xcconfig via App's
     - REPLACE Settings or create a new Client for other FHIR Servers
     */
    class func SMARTSandbox() -> FHIRManager {

        let infoDict = Bundle.main.infoDictionary!
        guard var baseURI = infoDict["FHIR_BASE_URL"] as? String else {
            fatalError("Need FHIR Endpoint")
        }
        if !baseURI.hasPrefix("http") {
            baseURI = "https://" + baseURI
        }

        let settings = [
            "client_name"   : "easipro-clinic",
            "client_id"     : "easipro-clinic-id",
            "redirect"      : "smartmarkers-home://smartcallback",
            "scope"         : "openid profile user/*.* launch"
        ]
        let smart_baseURL = URL(string: baseURI)!
        let client = Client(baseURL: smart_baseURL, settings: settings)
        client.authProperties.granularity = .tokenOnly

        //Initalize PROMIS FHIR server client with base uri, id, secret
        let promis = PROMISClient(..)
        return FHIRManager(main: client, promis: promis)
    }
}

  /*
  Initialize FHIRManager
  Can be done in AppDelegate
  */

lazy var fhir: FHIRManager! = {
        return FHIRManager.SMARTSandbox()
    }()


// Catch callback for SMART authorization
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {

        if fhir.main.awaitingAuthCallback {
            return fhir.main.didRedirect(to: url)
        }

        return false
    }
```

SMART Markers
-------------
This app was built on top of the SMART Markers framework but with its own custom interface and user experience designed specifically for PROMIS instruments and has now expanded to include various instruments enabled by the framework. [ResearchKit][rk] and [SwiftSMART][sw] are used as its submodules
